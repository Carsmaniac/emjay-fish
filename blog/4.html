                <h2>Week 4: Big Boi Blues</h2>
                <p>
                    We're back, with a big boi Tamagotchi and a grumpy Transformer, what's not to love? This week is, well, a week late, meaning week 4 is technically week 5? Eh, don't think about it too hard. Let's just dive
                    into some silly toys that bring joy to my life, and hopefully entertain you, at least a little bit.

                            Whoa, that's a big Tamagotchi! Yeah! :) The Deka Tamagotchi line is a series of companion devices, meant to sit at home while you're out playing with your regular tama, ready for you to come back 
                            and transfer Gotchi Points you earned on them to your primary device. For that reason, this tama doesn't let you raise a character like normal, but rather you play minigames to earn Gotchi Points,
                            and use those to upgrade your home and transfer to other compatible devices, in this case the Keitai, Keitai Akai, Entama and Uratama, the first and third I've already featured on the blog. It's also
                            just a cool thing to have sitting on your desk! And a very big and awkward thing to carry around with you day to day.

                        <p class="info">Released 2011<br>Designed by Hironori Kobayashi & Andrew Scribner</p>
                        <p>
                            Hey, it's Kup, everyone's favourite cranky old man! Kup's got no time for your nonsense, he's been bashing Decepticons since before you were born, kiddo. Kup transforms into a pickup truck, but I'm not
                            interested in that scene, as far as I'm concerned he transforms into a <em>ute</em>, and no-one can tell me otherwise. Kup looks great, he really does exude the grumpy old man vibe in robot form, with
                            the visor covering the lower part of his face and his big backpack sticking up behind him. His musket laser is lovely, enabling an intimidating two-handed grip, or visibly slung over his shoulder when
                            he needs to get his hands dirty. And I love how it forms the exhaust pipe in his vehicle mode! A really neat detail that sold me on this figure.

                        <h2>2007 Porsche 911 GT3 &mdash; Metalflake Brown</h2>
                        <p class="info">Released 2025<br>Designed by Ryu Asada<br>Toy number MB729</p>
                        <p>
                            Wait a second, this is a Matchbox car, not a Hot Wheels! Well too bad, I make the rules here. The Porsche GT3 is legendary, it was first produced in the 90s, but has its roots in the high performance
                            homologation models of the 70s. It offers a nice balance between the standard 911 and the more stripped-down, less practical but more insane 911 GT3 RS, turning it into a car that can turn heads but isn't
                            as much of a pain to daily as an RS. A car I could feasibly own, how exciting! This particular example is part of the 997 generation of the late 2000s, which happens to be at the tail end of when my taste
                            for cars started developing, thanks to the Need for Speed games, so I happen to think this generation is <em>gorgeous</em> looking. I think it's captured really well in this Matchbox as well, the tampograph
                            on the lights is a little janky, but the shape of the body is wonderful.

                        <h3>Bread Tag of the Week:</h3>
                        <h2><i>Palpatophora glyphodorsalis</i> &mdash; green</h2>
                        <p class="info">Manufactured by Kwik Lok<br>Manufacturer code J-NRP TGR-2</p>
                        <p>
                            Ah, the glyphodorsalis, one of the most widely distributed species of bread tag in the world (I think??). It's the little brother to the ubiquitous and iconic <i>Palpatophora utiliformis</i>, sporting the same
                            body shape but a shrunken down mouth. This thing used to be a very common sight in supermarkets here in Australia, but it's been slowly replaced by cardboard occlupanopsids in recent years, making its fate
                            rather uncertain, much like all other plastic occlupanids. The shade of green I picked out for this week's specimen is actually quite a common colour among Kwik Lok bread tags, but I really like it, a nice
                            slightly blueish light green. This particular specimen also has an expiry date of the 4th of July, possibly the single most American date on the calendar, and yet the only one they pronounce in the <em>correct</em>
                            format of day before month ;)

                        <h2>ETS2 Globex Paint Job Pack</h2>
                        <p class="info">Released June 2019</p>
                        <p>
                            This was the first trucksim paint job mod I ever released on Steam Workshop, and it remains my most subscribed mod to this day, with over 10 000 current users. Maybe not surprising, given the considerable amount of 
                            work that went into making it. This paint job features a circular logo and stripe that line up perfectly when carrying a Globex-painted trailer with a 4x2 chassis truck, which took quite a while to get right on 
                            <em>every</em> truck. Globex was a VTC, or virtual trucking company, that I was a part of throughout its lifetime. Rising from the ashes of the Southern Freight Company VTC, cruising with the Globex gang marked a 
                            wonderful spot on my weekly calendar, so this paint job is pretty nostalgic for me. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
